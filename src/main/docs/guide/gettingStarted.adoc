In this guide you will learn how to write and test GORM *event listeners*. GORM event listeners allow you to write methods that are called when objects are saved, updated, or deleted from the database, in order to perform custom logic (perhaps creating a log entry, updating/creating a related object, or modifying a property in the persisted object). These listeners leverage the async capabilities of Grails, but add some helpful shortcuts specific to capturing events from your domain classes.

TIP: You may be familiar with the persistence event handlers available on domain classes, such as `beforeInsert`, `afterInsert`, `beforeUpdate`, etc. Event listeners essentially allow you to perform the same sort of logic that you might have placed in these domain class methods. However, event listeners generally promote better code organziation, and because they are added to the Spring context, they can call service methods and other Spring beans, unlike domain classes (which by default are not autowired and do not participate in dependency-injection).
